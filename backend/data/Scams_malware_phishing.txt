1. Add security features such as downloading the ScamShield app or ScamShield Bot on WhatsApp to block scams and report scams
2. Check for scam signs with official sources
3. Tell the authorities and warn your MDW friends

How to spot scams?
1. Urgent Payment Requests
Scammers create a sense of urgency, threatening to take immediate action if you do not transfer money right away. This tactic pressures victims to act quickly without verifying the source.
2. Requests for Personal Information
Scammers may pose as government officials or representatives from legitimate businesses and ask for sensitive information, like bank details, ID numbers, or passwords, claiming it’s needed for verification, security, or to resolve an issue on your account.
3. Requests for Secrecy
Scammers often urge you to keep the interaction confidential, warning you not to inform others. This tactic aims to isolate you and prevent verification with trusted sources.
4. Suspicious Signs in Contact Information
In phone scams, a local number with a “+” prefix can indicate a spoofed call. For messages or emails, look for unusual sender addresses, spelling errors, or URLs that don’t match the claimed organization. These signs suggest the contact may be fraudulent.

Types of scams
What is a phishing scam?
If you receive a message from an unknown person asking you to click on an unknown link to provide your personal details, be careful! It could be a phishing scam to steal your personal information and money. Avoid clicking on any links or sharing your personal information.
What is an internet love scam?
If you meet someone who confesses his love in a short time, then suddenly needs help and asks you for money, it is likely a scam. Don't send money to him.
Loan scams
Loan scammers claim to be licensed money lenders offering legal loan services. You may encounter them through unwanted phone calls or text messages, or through online advertisements.
They promise instant loan approvals but will request that you transfer fees before they pay out the money. When you've transferred the fees, they either disappear entirely, or use the personal information you've provided to harass you for further payments.

Scam prevention tips:
1. Add security features
2. Check for signs
3. Tell the authorities and warn your MDW friends
4. Add the ScamShield app to block incoming calls from scammers and detect scam SMSes. Download from the official app store or playstore
5. Check for scam signs. Use trusted sources like the Singapore Police Force, National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) and Scamalert.sg for the latest updates.
You can also contact the NCPC's anti-scam hotline at 1800-722-6688 (airtime charges apply for mobile calls to 1800 service lines). If you are unsure, say no, hang up or delete the call or message.
6. Tell authorities and friends. If you encounter scams, report to the authorities and warn your fellow MDWs so that they can avoid being scammed. You can also report scam calls and messages you received via the ScamShield app or ScamShield Bot.


Common Scamming Tactics

SPF and CSA have identified a common set of tactics used by scammers on social media platforms and e-commerce websites. These tactics are illustrated in the attached Annex A, which outlines the typical attack stages of such scams.

Social Engineering Tactics:

Enticing Promotions: Fake advertisements or promotions lure users with attractive offers.
Inauthentic Behavior and Bots: Bots or fake accounts create an illusion of legitimacy.
Building Trust: Scammers attempt to gain trust through phone calls, text messages, using local language, or sounding professional.
Social Engineering: Scammers gather information through seemingly relevant questions.
Deceptive Tactics: Scammers use tactics like requesting small deposits or issuing invoices to appear legitimate.
Installation of Malicious Apps:

After gaining trust, scammers direct victims to download apps from unofficial sources.
They may provide instructions on how to bypass Android security controls to install the app.
Fake apps often have professional-looking interfaces, further deceiving victims.
Scammers may pressure hesitant victims or suggest using another phone if they have an iPhone.
Why Android Devices Are Targeted

Android's open nature allows for more app development flexibility but also makes it easier for scammers to distribute malicious apps. Users can download and install apps (sideload) from sources outside the official Google Play Store, making Android a more appealing target for scammers.

Important Note: Android devices are not inherently less secure. Scammers cannot bypass security controls unless users are deceived. Users of Android devices are advised to be aware of the risks and follow best practices to safeguard their devices.

Safety Tips for Online Offers

Be Skeptical: If the offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Verify its legitimacy with the company through official sources.
Avoid Unknown Apps: Only download apps from official app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Be wary of apps requesting unnecessary permissions.
Be Cautious of Payment Requests: Avoid offers requiring unconventional payment methods like bank transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrency.
Report Suspicious Content: Report suspicious offers to the social media platform to protect others.
Share with Care: Verify the legitimacy of offers before sharing them with others.
What to Do if You Fall Victim

Switch to Flight Mode: Disconnect your device from the internet to prevent further access.
Run an Anti-Virus Scan: Use an anti-virus software to scan and remove any detected malware.
Check for Unauthorized Transactions: Contact your bank if you suspect unauthorized transactions in your bank account(s) or Singpass account.
Report the Incident: Report the incident to the police at any Neighbourhood Police Post or online at https://eservices.police.gov.sg. You may also report it to SingCERT at https://go.gov.sg/singcert-incident-reporting-form.
Further Steps (Optional)

Boot in Safe Mode and Uninstall Apps: If you believe your phone is not infected, boot into safe mode, uninstall suspicious apps, and install mobile security software. Consider a factory reset and changing passwords.

Understanding Phishing and Scams
What is Phishing?
Phishing is when scammers try to trick you into giving them your personal information, like passwords or credit card numbers, usually through fake emails or websites that look real.
Simple Tips to Stay Safe Online
Think Before You Click:
If you receive an email or message that seems suspicious or asks for personal information, pause and think. Is it from someone you know? Does it make sense? Always double-check before clicking any links or downloading attachments.
Check the URL:
Before entering any sensitive information online, look at the website's address. It should start with "https://" and have a padlock icon. If it doesn't, avoid entering your information.
Use Strong Passwords:
Create unique passwords for different accounts. A good password is at least 12 characters long and includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Consider using a password manager to keep track of them.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
Whenever possible, turn on 2FA for your accounts. This means that even if someone gets your password, they would also need a second piece of information (like a code sent to your phone) to access your account.
Keep Software Updated:
Regularly update your computer and apps. These updates often include important security fixes that protect you from new threats.
Be Wary of Public Wi-Fi:
Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for sensitive transactions like banking. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to secure your connection.
Use Antivirus Software:
Install antivirus software on your devices to help detect and block malware before it can cause harm.
Backup Your Data:
Regularly back up important files on an external hard drive or cloud storage. This way, if something goes wrong, you won't lose everything.
Educate Yourself About Scams:
Stay informed about common scams and phishing techniques by following trusted news sources or websites dedicated to cybersecurity awareness.
Report Suspicious Activity:
If you encounter a scam or phishing attempt, report it to the relevant authorities (like your local police or a national cybercrime reporting center) to help protect others.


Key Signs of Phishing
Suspicious Sender:
Check the email address closely. Phishing emails often come from addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but may have slight misspellings or unusual domains (e.g., @example.com instead of @example.org).
Generic Greetings:
Be wary of emails that start with generic terms like "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name. Legitimate companies usually address you by your name.
Urgent Requests:
Phishing messages often create a sense of urgency, urging you to act quickly to avoid consequences (e.g., "Your account will be suspended unless you verify your information immediately").
Spelling and Grammar Mistakes:
Many phishing emails contain noticeable spelling and grammatical errors. Professional organizations typically proofread their communications.
Unusual Links or Attachments:
Hover over any links (without clicking) to see the actual URL. If it looks suspicious or doesn’t match the company’s official website, don’t click it. Be cautious with unexpected attachments as they may contain malware.
Requests for Personal Information:
Legitimate companies will never ask for sensitive information (like passwords or Social Security numbers) via email. If an email requests this information, it’s likely a scam.
Too Good to Be True Offers:
Be skeptical of offers that seem too good to be true, such as winning a prize you didn’t enter for or receiving unexpected refunds.
Impersonation of Trusted Sources:
Phishers often impersonate trusted organizations, including banks or government agencies. If you receive a message from a known entity asking for information, contact them directly using official channels to verify the request.
Unusual Behavior from Friends:
If you receive a message from a friend asking for money or personal information, especially if it seems out of character, verify with them directly through a phone call or another method.
Pop-Up Messages:
Be cautious of pop-up messages that appear while browsing the web, especially those asking for personal information or claiming your device is infected.
Conclusion
By being aware of these signs and practicing caution when interacting with emails and messages, users can significantly reduce their risk of falling victim to phishing scams. Always remember: if something feels off, it’s better to double-check than to act hastily! 


DBS SMS Phishing Alert Date: 06 April 2023
Description: Beware of phishing SMSes targeting you with fake DBS promotions, such as DBS Fixed Deposits offering 4.28% p.a. for 6 months. These SMSes may ask you to contact a phone number to learn more. However, these SMSes are scams, and the person on the other end is not a DBS representative.

The scammer may attempt to trick you into transferring money to their bank account, or they
may request your DBS login information and digital token approval code. If they acquire this
information, they can use it to steal your bank funds or access your account without your
permission.
Never reveal sensitive details to scammers, such as your login credentials or PINs, as they can
use this information to conduct unauthorized transactions on your cards or bank account.

If you have shared your Username-PIN Code combination with any non-DBS websites or mobile
applications, we strongly advise changing your PIN Code immediately.
